        <p>Mathematical Medicine LLC is a research organization specializing in statistical methodology and large-scale data curation projects, with a particular emphasis on statistical genetics and genetic data.</p>
        
        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
        
        <h3>Veronica Vieland, PhD</h3>
        <p><em>Executive Director</em></p>
        <p>Dr. Veronica Vieland is the founder and Executive Director of Mathematical Medicine LLC. Throughout her academic career, Dr. Vieland’s research has focused on the measurement of statistical evidence, both from a theoretical perspective and also as the foundation for understanding human genetic and genomic data. On the genetics side, she focuses on developing statistical methods for discovering the genetic architecture of complex clinical phenotypes. She has led development of a novel class of statistical genetic techniques, implemented in the computer package <span class="sc">Kelvin</span>, and used <span class="sc">Kelvin</span> to study the genetics of numerous clinical conditions, including autism, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, cleft lip and palate, autoimmune thyroid disease, papillary thyroid cancer and genetic modifiers in Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The other arm of this work has been the development of the high-performance computational approaches required to utilize the methods. On the theoretical side, she is developing an absolute scale for the measurement of statistical evidence, following the template of the absolute scale for measurement of temperature.</p>
        <p>Dr. Vieland received her undergraduate degree in Philosophy from Barnard College and graduate degrees in Philosophy (Mathematical Logic and Philosophy of Science) and Biostatistics from Columbia University, where she also completed a Postdoctoral Fellowship in the Department of Child Psychiatry. Subsequent to completing her training, she was an academic for over 30 years, most recently serving as the Battelle Endowed Chair in Computational Biology at The Abigail Wexner Research Institute at Nationwide Children’s Hospital, where she also served as Vice President for Computational Research and as the Director of the Battelle Center for Mathematical Medicine, and as Professor in the Departments of Pediatrics and Statistics at The Ohio State University, where she remains Professor Emerita. She has published over 150 papers and presented her work at numerous national and international venues. She has been the recipient of two NIH Career Development Awards, and she is an elected fellow of the American Psychopathological Association (APPA) and the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS).</p>
